# Prodigo ERP Application UI

Always load and follow `prodigo-design-system`.

ERP screens prioritize: clarity, efficiency, data readability, consistency, accessibility, visual polish — in that order. Do not sacrifice usability for decoration.

## Standard Page Structure

Breadcrumb → page header → page description → primary actions → filters → KPI cards (where useful) → main content.

## Page Header

Heading + one-line description + actions aligned right. Example:

```
Produits                          [Importer] [Ajouter un produit]
"Gérez les produits et le stock de votre entreprise."
```

## KPI Cards

Use when metrics help users understand the page (total products, low stock, inventory value, overdue invoices, ...). White cards, 12px radius, subtle shadow, strong number, small label.

## Filters

Common filters: search, status, category, date range, warehouse, assigned user. Filter bars sit above the table. Prefer URL params for shareable filter state where practical.

## Tables

Consistent header, rows, actions, pagination, selection, empty/loading/error states. Rows 52–60px, header gray-50, hover gray-50, selected primary-light, actions right-aligned. Support sorting and pagination.

## Forms / CRUD

- Use drawers for quick create/edit.
- Use full pages for complex workflows.
- Use modals only for confirmations, small forms, and destructive actions.

## Business UX

Destructive actions (delete, cancel invoice, deactivate, remove user) always require confirmation. Loading, empty, and error states are mandatory — never a blank page or unhandled failure.

## Status

Use consistent semantic status badges (see design system). Never invent new colors for statuses.

## Data Formatting

Currency, dates, and numbers must be formatted consistently per the tenant's locale/currency — never hardcode presentation formatting across components. Extract formatters into shared helpers.

## Feature Structure

Feature code is colocated under `src/features/<feature>/` (api, components, hooks, schemas, types). Data comes from the Spring Boot API through the axios client — never hardcode responses.
